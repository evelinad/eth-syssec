# Part 3: Security of x86-based Systems
## Application Security
- Requirements
	- Launch-time Integrity: correct application was started/loaded
	- Run-time Isolation: no interference from malicious software/peripherals possible
	- Secure Persistent Storage
	- Code should have launch-time integrity and run-time isolation
	- Volatile data should have launch-time integrity and run-time isolation
	- Persistent data should be able to use a secure persistent storage
- Required functionality
	- Launch-time Integrity: integrity (e.g. hashes) verification of initial code and data
	- Run-time Isolation:
		- prevent unauthorised modification of code and data
		- prevent run-time attacks to modify execution flow
	- Secure Storage:
		- confidentiality
		- integrity protection
	- This security functionality must be secured too
	- Unclear where and how to implement the functionality

## Platform Overview
- Processor: contains one or more CPUs (called "cores" in this lecture)
	- MMU: Memory Management Unit
	- Programmable Interrupt Controller
	- Intel VMX: Virtual Machine Extensions
	- L1, L2 caches for each core
	- L3 cache shared by all cores
- Chipset: connects processor to memory and peripherals
- Peripherals: connected to the chipset through multiple bus-interfaces

## OS-Based Security
- Privilege Rings
	- Ring 0: Kernel
	- Ring 1: Device Drivers
	- Ring 2: Device Drivers
	- Ring 3: Applications
	- Lower number -> higher privileges
	- Nowadays only Ring 0 and Ring 3 are used
	- Device drivers part of the kernel now
	- Processor tracks Current Privilege Level (CPL) using two register bits
	- Used to limit access to privileged instructions and I/O ports
	- In the past used to protect kernel memory
- Paging-based Security: Security relevant data in page table entries
	- Supervisor bit: if set, page only accessible by ring 0 (isolates operating system from applications)
	- RW bits: allows to distinguish between read-only and writeable pages
	- Execution disable (ED) bit: if set, page isn't executable (e.g. prevents run-time code injection)
- DMA through IOMMU
	- Use IOMMU (Input/Output Memory Management Unit)
	- Controls DMA access to physical memory
	- Set up by operating system
	- Allows to make sure DMA access is not done to security relevant pages (page tables, kernel pages, etc.)

## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- Parts of the TPM
	- Non-volatile Storage
	- RAM
	- Execution Engine
	- RSA Engine
	- Random Number Generator
	- Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs)
		- PCR 0 to PCR 15
		- only reset at system boot
		- each 128 bits
		- Only writeable by `extend` operation: \\(\operatorname{extend}(PCR_i, data) = \operatorname{SHA-1}(PCR_i || \operatorname{SHA-1}(data))\\)
		- Used as a *hash-chain* to store *log of events*
		- Only final event is checked. Check fails if any intermediate value was incorrect
	- SHA1 Engine
- Interfaced over memory mapped I/O
	- memory page reserved for TPM
	- reading/writing to it equals a read/write to the corresponding TPM register
	- modern TPMs use «Low Pin Count (LPC)» bus interface
- TPM 1.2 uses asymmetric crypto
- each key is for decryption or signing, never both
- Keys stored in TPM
	- Endorsement Key: certified by TPM vendor, used to establishing the presence and correctness of the TPM
	- Storage Root Key: used for secure storage (e.g. encryption of other keys stored on disk), generated the moment an entity takes ownership of the TPM
	- Attestation Identity Key: certified by third party based on endorsement key, used to sign non-migratable TPM data or keys (e.g. PCR's value). Generated by the TPM, it's not possible to find out the Endorsement Key by knowing the public part of the Attestation Identity Key.
- Key types
	- Migratable: generated in TPM, transferable between TPMs
	- Non-migratable: generated in TPM, private part never leaves TPM
- Primary Usage
	- Secure Boot: operating system boots only if the chain of trust is valid (BIOS, Boot Loader, Operating System)
	- Authenticated Boot: system uses chain of trust to record everything loaded. Operating system boots even if chain results in an invalid value
	- Cryptographic Co-Processor: use TPM to generate keys, encrypt, decrypt and perform hashing
	- Secure Storage: store non-migratable keys
	- Trusted Log: store hash-chain in PCRs
	- Attestation: proof system state to some party by sending and signing the trusted log (i.e. hash-chain). Attestation Identity Key is used to sign.

## Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- Smart Cards
	- e.g. with a Java Runtime
	- Dedicated and constrained TEE
- Trusted Execution Technology
	- e.g. TrustZone by ARM
	- System-wide TEE
- Software Guard Extensions
	- Concurrent TEE
- Dedicated powerful TEEs (e.g. by HP)

## Secure Execution Environment (SEE): Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)
- Hardware components
	- CPU extended with new instruction: e.g. `SENTER` to enter SEE and `SEXIT` to exit SEE
	- Chipset contains additional SEE configuration registers
		- Adress Range Filtering: Used to setup the secure environment
		- Additional registers used to setup and use the secure environment
	- TPM used
		- PCR 16 to PCR 23 used
		- these are dynamically resettable PCRs, i.e. can be reset before system reboots
		- Access to PCRs over five memory pages governed by chipset that enforces access privilege levels
	- Cache-as-RAM support
- Software components
	- BIOS support needed: designates a single core that is allowed to execute `SENTER` and `SEXIT`, sets up DMA Protected Region, writes TXT registers
	- Authenticated Code Module: signed code module provided by Intel. Used to bootstrap a secure environment
	- Measured Launched Environment: The SEE environment. May also refer to the application running inside the secure environment
	- Operating System support needed: Adds Measured Launched Environment to DMA Protected Region, writes meta-data into TXT heap (e.g. entry-point)
- Authenticated Code Module is executed in cache (using Cache-as-RAM)
- `SENTER` steps
	1. OS disables: paging, all interrupts, executes `SENTER`
	2. BIOS' selected core: checks paging, interrupt status, requests other cores to sleep
	3. BIOS' selected core: fetches Authenticated Code Module into cache, checks signature, puts hash of it into one of the dynamically resettable registers
	4. Authenticated Code Module is execute (in cache!): checks location and integrity of Measured Launched Environment, hashes it and puts it into one of the dynamically resettable registers
	5. Measured Launched Environment starts execution, can wakeup other cores
- Important properties during measurements
	- During measurements operating system is suspended and can't interfere
	- Because all interrupts are disabled the same is true for peripherals
	- PCRs used only reset by the chipset (set to 0), chipset recognises `SENTER` when processor uses a special bus cycle

## ARM TrustZone
- Virtual processor with configurable system resources it can use
- Virtual processor is a special, secure, system running a trusted operating system
- Advantages: faster than a Smart Card, familiar software development model
- Trusted operating system
	- may verify integrity of application
	- may provide secure and persistent storage
- Hardware components are TrustZone aware
- Limitations
	- hard to implement a secure and trustworthy operating system
	- implementing interface to outside world also hard
	- each hardware/software piece must trust other pieces running in the secure environment

## Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)
- Scales well: each application runs in a separate Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
	- compromising one of the applications in the TEE can't compromise other applications
	- compromised operating system not a problem
	- Eavesdropping on the Bus or malicious DMA access can't access sensitive parts
- No trust put into the operating system
	- Although it manages the TEE memory, it can't access it because it's encrypted
- Limitations
	- Overhead introduced by cryptographic functions used
	- Context switching costly
	- No peripheral access, e.g. no I/O

## Java Cards
- Uses Java Card Run-Time Environment (JCRE)
- Applications implemented as Applet, each Applet runs separated from other Applets
- Java has some nice security relevant properties: strongly typed, access control to attributes/methods, no pointers
- Applets separated by «Applet Firewall»: enforces access control through permissions and role-based rules
- Cryptographic support: e.g. integrity verification and authentication for Applets
- Each Applet has its own hierarchical filesystem
- Attacks still possible
	- Invasive attacks: memory readout, bus probing, etc.
	- Remote attacks: JCRE bugs, weak cryptography, etc.
	- Primary problem: hard resource constraints

## Runtime Attack Basics
- Exploit application's vulnerabilities
- Control-flow attack
- Code Injection: Adding new *node* to Control Flow Graph
	- attacker can execute arbitrary code
	- generally considered more powerful
- Code Reuse: Adding a new *path* to Control Flow Graph
	- attacker is limited to use of nodes already in Control Flow Graph
- Nowadays attackers use both techniques (code injection and reuse)
- Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
	- prevent execution of data located inside writeable memory location
	- widely adapted by operating systems and hardware

## Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)
